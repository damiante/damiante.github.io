# Project context

I am of Italian-Australian descent; my grandparents on my father's side were first-generation migrants to Australia. This means I grew up experiencing some of the Italian-Australian culture and certainly a lot of its food.

My Nonni have been dead for some years now, and so my Nonna's cooking has been too. However, when she died and the house was sold, my mum and my aunt packaged up much of my Nonna's old things such as cutlery and crockery for when one of the grandchildren needed it to furnish a first-home purchase. I was the lucky heir to these hand-me-downs and in amongst the things were Nonna's old recipe notes. Unfortunately they were handwritten in cursive and in Sicilian dialect, using many Australian English loan words.

Fortunately with the advent of generative AI using image input modalities, traditional OCR is not required to transcribe the image content, and using a language model's rich context means that the intent of words and their context can be used to infer the meaning even when the words are non-standard.

This project contains the transcriptions of these notes, or rather, it contains the synthesised recipes created from the transcriptions. As much of the original content has been retained as possible and references to the original note images have been included so that manual checking can be done. I hope in some way this can preserve some of Nonna's cooking for the future :)

## Notes

Some recipe names contain "_PARTIAL" - in these the AI was not able to complete a recipe. The instructions are also very simple - no doubt Nonna remembered what she had to do from only simple reminders.
