# Italian Pear Nut Sponge

## Ingredients
- 750 grams firm ripe pears
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 225 grams plain flour
- Pinch of salt
- 1½ teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 125 grams (ml) sunflower oil (less than ½ cup)
- 165 grams caster sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 60 grams walnuts, coarsely chopped
- 100 grams sultanas
- Icing sugar to decorate

## Instructions
1. Peel and core the pears and cut into small chunks
2. Sprinkle with the lemon juice to prevent discoloration
3. Sift the flour, salt, bicarbonate of soda, and ginger together. Set aside with the pears
4. Put the oil, caster sugar, whole egg, and egg yolk into a bowl, beat together well
5. Gradually stir in flour a spoonful at a time, taking care not to overheat the mixture
6. Oven at 300°F (150°C)
7. Stir the lemon zest, chopped walnuts, and sultanas into the mixture, followed by the pear pieces, making sure that everything is evenly mixed
8. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour 10 minutes or until golden and a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean. It may need a little longer cooking, depending on the ripeness of the pears
9. Remove the cake from the oven and leave to rest in the tin for 10 minutes
10. Take the cake out of the tin, carefully peel off the lining paper and leave to cool on a plate
11. Dust with a little icing sugar to decorate, serve with whipped cream
