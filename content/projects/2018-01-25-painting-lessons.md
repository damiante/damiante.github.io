In 2018 I took painting lessons in the hopes that it would help me
understand the basics of painting (light/shadow, colour, etc.).

I had previously taken a course at university called ["Perceptions,
Illusions and Art"][opto20004], which was about how artists use painting
techniques to trick the eye into perceiving properties inherent to
binocular vision such as depth, shadow, transparency, etc. on what is
in effect a 2d plane (i.e. a canvas).

I was hoping that this course would help me apply some of those techniques
as a beginner painter. However I found the lessons to be quite loose and
freeform, and not as technical as I had hoped. As a result I didn't feel
that I got too much out of it.

Painting in general is something I find frustrating; it's not obvious to
me why I can observe things in an image but am unable to replicate it
on a canvas. I think it's just practice, but practicing things I'm bad at
is a frustrating process. 

I will definitely do more painting in future,
but right now I feel that I have to be in a particular mood to be able
to make progress with it.
