In late 2019 I took a beginner's sailing course. The course was designed
to teach adults to sail dinghies in pairs by teaching introductory sailing
techniques, parts of the boat, ropework, etc.

I have this romantic idea of taking my boat out onto the water and having
a relaxing day on the ocean eating a picnic lunch or reading a book etc.

I think in hindsight this is a bit unrealistic; for a start, any keelboat
big enough to have a relatively stable deck seems to require several crew.

Secondly, a sailboat has a lot of moving parts that are complex and require
specific domain knowledge. It's not like a powerboat where you can just hop
in and push the accelerator to go.
<br>
Finally, sailing scales exponentially in price as the boat gets larger,
so I'm not sure I'll be able to afford it. I've heard it said that "a boat
is a hole in the water that you throw money into" and I don't find that
prospect very appealing.

If I end up living somewhere with a healthy community sailing club, I might
pick it up again. I don't think I've retained much from my lessons but
the experience was certainly valuable.
