# Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies

This is my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. After years of experimentation, I've found this creates the perfect balance of soft, chewy centers with slightly crispy edges.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)
2. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl
3. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and both sugars until fluffy
4. Beat in eggs and vanilla
5. Gradually blend in the flour mixture
6. Fold in chocolate chips
7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets
8. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown
9. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire rack

## Tips

- **For chewier cookies**: Slightly underbake them (9 minutes instead of 11)
- **For crispier cookies**: Bake a bit longer and use a bit less brown sugar
- **Storage**: Keep in an airtight container for up to a week
- **Freezing**: The dough freezes beautifully - make a double batch!

## Variations I've Tried

- Add 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans
- Replace half the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips
- Add a pinch of cinnamon to the dry ingredients
- Use dark chocolate chips for a richer flavor
