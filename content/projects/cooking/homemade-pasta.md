# Homemade Pasta from Scratch

Making fresh pasta at home is one of those things that seems intimidating but is actually quite simple. The results are absolutely worth it - fresh pasta has a texture and flavor that dried pasta just can't match.

## Ingredients

For basic egg pasta:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## Equipment Needed

- Large wooden cutting board or clean counter
- Fork
- Rolling pin (or pasta machine if you have one)
- Sharp knife or pasta cutter

## Instructions

### Making the Dough

1. Mound the flour on your work surface and make a well in the center
2. Crack the eggs into the well, add salt and olive oil
3. Using a fork, beat the eggs and gradually incorporate the flour from the edges
4. Once it becomes too thick to mix with a fork, use your hands
5. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic
6. Wrap in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature

### Rolling and Cutting

1. Divide the dough into 4 pieces (keep unused portions covered)
2. On a floured surface, roll out each piece as thin as possible (about 1/16 inch)
3. Let the sheets dry for 10 minutes (they should feel leathery but not brittle)
4. Roll up each sheet loosely and cut into desired width
5. Unroll the noodles and dust with flour to prevent sticking

### Cooking

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil
2. Add pasta and cook for 2-3 minutes (much faster than dried pasta!)
3. Drain and toss with your favorite sauce

## Pro Tips

- **The Dough Feel**: The dough should be smooth and slightly tacky, not sticky. Add flour or water as needed
- **Resting is Key**: Don't skip the 30-minute rest - it makes the dough much easier to roll
- **Thickness Matters**: For fettuccine, aim for about 1/16 inch. For ravioli, go even thinner
- **Fresh is Best**: Use the pasta the same day for best texture, or dry it completely for storage

## Sauce Pairings

Fresh pasta pairs wonderfully with:
- Simple butter and sage
- Classic marinara
- Creamy alfredo
- Carbonara (my personal favorite!)

## My Experience

I was nervous the first time I tried making pasta, but it quickly became one of my favorite weekend cooking projects. There's something meditative about kneading the dough and rolling it out. Plus, homemade pasta impresses dinner guests every time!
