This is a list of some projects I've got on the horizon. I update this from time to time.

## Automate my workday setup

I'm a software engineer and delivery manager, and the start of my day is usually very predictable. I boot my laptop, open Outlook, open Slack, open Teams, open Chrome and navigate to certain bookmarks, open IntelliJ and load the project I worked on the day before, etc etc. I'd like to script this to make the first 15 minutes of my day faster so I can get on with my actual work.

## Smart home automation

I have a few smart home devices but they're not really integrated in any meaningful way. I'd like to set up some more sophisticated automations using Home Assistant or similar. For example, automatically turning on lights when I get home, or adjusting the thermostat based on the weather forecast.

## Learn a new programming language

I've been meaning to dive deeper into Rust for a while now. I think it would be a good exercise to build a small CLI tool or web service in Rust to get more familiar with its ownership model and ecosystem.

## Build a personal knowledge base

I want to create a better system for organizing my notes, bookmarks, and learnings. Something like a personal wiki or Zettelkasten system that makes it easy to connect ideas and find information later.
