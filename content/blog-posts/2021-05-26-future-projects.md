I want to keep a list of all the things I would like to do but haven't
done yet. As I do these things, I will link them to their articles in
Projects. These are not in any particular order.

- Ceramics, particularly for use as crockery
- Mycoculture
- Simple electrical work such as installing LED lighting in a piece
- Woodworking (esp. furniture)
- Metalworking
- [Dorodango](https://www.laurenceking.com/blog/2019/09/26/dorodango-blog/)
- Automated self-sufficient farming
- Indoor aquaponics to grow fish & vegetables
- Resin casting for use in woodwork or simply art
- Mixology
