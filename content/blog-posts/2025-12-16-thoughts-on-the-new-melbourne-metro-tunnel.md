I live in Melbourne, Australia. Recently, a major extension to our primary suburban rail network (Melbourne Metro) has been completed and opened to the public.

Melbourne's train network has traditionally operated on a hub-and-spoke model, where nearly all trains go into or out of the city centre. The central stations are connected via a loop service which roughly circumscribes the Hoddle Grid, the grid of streets bounding the CBD. The new Melbourne Metro Tunnel bypasses this loop by passing straight through the city from roughly Northwest to Southeast. This necessitated the build of 5 new stations from North to South: Arden, Parkville, State Library, Town Hall, and Anzac.

This weekend I toured the new stations and I thought I'd write a review of them. Before I list and score the stations (and to bury the lede further) I'd like to articulate the criteria against which I am scoring them with a rough outline of my views on public transport and its function.

# Land of the Rising Sun

As will come to no surprise to those who know me, I am something of a Japanophile. I speak enough of the language to be dangerous and have been there twice in as many years.

One thing which anyone who visits can attest to is the quality of the public transport. Japan lives in a sweet spot of "developed enough to afford quality public infrastructure projects" and "not developed enough that for everyone to afford to buy, store, and service a car." 

As a result the quantity and quality of available public transport options are both extremely high. Trains are often so frequent on busy urban lines like the Yamanote that they often don't post the next train's arrival time on platform boards.

This is partly out of a culture which values craftsmanship and the quality of work, but also out of necessity; due to the urban density of major cities like Tokyo and Osaka, heavy investment has been made by the Japanese government into the rail infrastructure. As such, these cities are very easily navigable nearly entirely by train. The cities are also extremely dense, filled with tall, mixed-use buildings. This kind of urban design is extremely sustainable and efficient, and has meant that rent in Tokyo is relatively affordable compared to similarly major urban areas in other countries.

It's my view that any major city in the world should strive to emulate this model. When you look at cities like New York, London, Sydney, or my city of Melbourne, the cost of living is astronomical and rents and property prices are highly unaffordable except by the wealthiest of people. 

Naturally due to the laws of supply and demand, we have only two options to fix this: reduce demand (unlikely given how desirable these places are to live) or increase supply. The success of Tokyo's model shows that the second option is probably the best choice.

Therefore, when considering matters of public infrasture policy, my criteria mostly revolve around how much they enable this form of upward urban expansionism. Although a major part of this is zoning and building and land use, I'll ignore that for the most part in this post and focus instead on only how the new stations fit in from a public transport perspective.

# We Built This City

Japanese train stations in dense urban areas usually take on one of two forms:
1. Huge landmarks connecting transport modes like suburban trains, bullet trains, busses, and (more rarely) trams, while also housing shopping centres, food courts, and other facilities.
2. Nondescript underground entrances which meld into surrounding building façades or are small enclosed stairwells on a major thoroughfare footpath.

Melbourne Central station is the closest we have in Melbourne to category 1. It's a 5-story shopping centre where the station entrance is in the basement. It's roughly analogous to something like Osaka Namba station or Tokyo Shinagawa station, albeit obviously at a much smaller scale. However, we really don't have much like category 2.

I originally wrote that I disliked many of the station entrances because they used up land that could otherwise be released for urban space (ie tall buildings) but I have since been informed (credit to [dbut2](https://github.com/dbut2) ) that there are significant [overstation development projects](https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/projects/metro-tunnel/construction/over-station-development) planned for the major offenders of Town Hall and State Library which makes this problem a lot more palatable. The largest remaining offender would be Arden Station which has substantial above-ground presence although I'll go into this a bit more later. Sufficed to say I am not supportive of its overground presence.

I also find that many of the interior spaces are odd and almost inhuman. There are many cavernous antechambers with high ceilings and large open platforms with escalators at opposite ends where the space has no apparent function. Originally I thought the white glass panels might be covering available retail spaces until retailers could be found, but the finished corners on these walls lead me to believe that they are in fact intended to simply be blank white walls. It gives the feeling of walking through a hospital or an empty art gallery. These spaces are sized as though the stations will have many platforms and thus require space for many people, but there are only two platforms, so I feel very confused as to why the interiors were designed with so much open floor.

I also strongly dislike that several of the platforms look identical. As I recall these are Parkville, State Library, and Town Hall. These platforms all have a tall ceiling with curved orange steel beams, evocative of the vaults of a cloister. I don't mind the "industrial chique" style of these, but the platforms are all _nearly identical_. If you weren't paying attention, you'd have no idea at a glance where you were until you got off the train and checked the signs. In my view this is a huge oversight which is easily fixed by simply making the powder-coated steel a different colour. If one could remember, "Oh Parkville is the green one and State Library is orange and Town Hall is purple" then at least they could be told apart.

Overall I feel that many of the spaces seem like architecture for the sake of architecture. These spaces were about showing off, not actually being functional, which is wild since "form follows function" is so deeply ingrained into students of architecture that ornamentation is considered a cardinal sin. 

# Breakdown

Having said my piece on the stations in general, I'll now briefly go through my thoughts on each one specifically. Unfortunately I won't be using many photographs as I didn't think about writing this article until towards the end of my tour at which point I had already visited all of the stations, so you'll have to take my word for my claims :)

I will score the stations on the following axes:
- Location in the city
- Connexion to other PT modes or terminals
- available retail or otherwise functional space
- architecture and design (external)
- layout / efficient traversal of the station (internal)

I will also discuss the stations in the order in which I visited them, which is entering from the Sunbury side, roughly North to South.

## Arden:
Arden station is probably my least favourite station of the whole lot. It has very few redeeming qualities.

Probably the best thing about Arden is that it doesn't feature the vaulted ceiling, so you can tell it apart from the other stations when alighting the train. However, once you ascend from the platform, you're greeted with narrow walkways around the escalator voids, and the clinical wall panels which serve no apparent purpose.

The walk from these escalators to those to the ground level is moderate, but at the ground level the whole structure is there above you. Huge amounts of land space are devoted to the weird, brick, hole-drilled-into-a-cube structure covering the station entrance. The design is evocative of an early internet shock image whose name I won't repeat, but IYKYK.

Arden station has precious little retail space, and that which was there was empty when I visited. Its location is also abysmal, being in the middle of a field at the bottom end of North Melbourne, alongside the Moonee Ponds Creek trail. There are also no connecting public transport services nearby; passengers must walk 550m to Abbotsford Street to catch the 57 tram.

I can only imagine that the choice to put Arden station where it is was made based on the price of available land and to facilitate a vanity project on the ground level. It would have been so much more sensible for Arden's station entrance to have been on Queensbury or Abbotsford Streets, such that commuters could exit the station and immediately find themselves in the heart of North Melbourne, able to visit the main district or connect to trams to Queen Victoria Market (or indeed onwards along the 57 route).

Arden station is a failure of imagination and an easy-way-out for the builders and I consider its existence to be extremely disappointing and a waste of potential.

## Parkville

With a complete about-face, Parkville is probably my favourite of the new stations. It's most glaring flaw is the use of the copy-paste cloister vault platform design. However, I feel it's most appropriate at this location as it evokes the sandstone cloistered vaults of the Old Quad at Melbourne University, my alma mater.

Ascending the escalators, one arrives in a single long strip of station interior, glowing with natural sunlight from the overhead skylights. The station also has abundant retail space; when I visited there was a convenience store and a sushi restaurant open and two fast food options nearly complete in construction, as well as a cafe and a supermarket in early stages of construction. The density here makes it feel a little like a tiny arcade, and while the chosen retailers may be somewhat questionable, I am at least glad that the space has been made available for this purpose, as opposed to simply wasted.

Parkville also features a large underpass underneath Royal Parade, enabling some rejigging of the lights to prioritise vehicle throughput without sacrificing pedestrian traffic. It feels appropriate too that the space connects the Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and the Melbourne University Medical Building. The station exits appropriately connect the metro to the 19 tram line. It might have been nice if the station had been closer to Swanston Street as this would have meant the station instead connected to the numerous tram lines which stop there, but that's a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things and certainly not as egregious a mistake as has been made by other stations whose names may or may not start with "A" and end with "rden."

## State Library

State Library is perhaps the least impressive of the new stations, being little more than a platform with exits to the street and a connection at one end to Melbourne Central. This is by no means a bad thing, however, as it would be gratuitous to take up more space than is necessary (looking at some of the other stations).

My main complaint about State Library aside from it using the identical platform style with the cloister ceiling is that its exit signage is odd. One exit is called "Swanston Street" and the other is called "Franklin Street." While it's true that the Franklin Street exit is _on_ Franklin Street, at the top of the escalator you face Swanston Street. So both exits face Swanston Street. If the so-called Swanston Street exit was equivalently named it should be called LaTrobe Street.

Also, I really hate the use of the above-ground space here. The zone which could otherwise have been used for productive space is instead allocated to a concrete tent covering in the entrance, permanently removing that space from functional use. You could literally have put 100 residences above it and there used to be such a building before it was demolished for the entrance to Town Hall station. In Japan this entrance would typically have been integrated into a building, or at least it would have been way smaller. This wasteful allocation of valuable inner-city land towards flaunting the talents of those employed to decorate it does long-term harm to the city's urban planning.

I do really like how seamless the connexion to Melbourne Central is, I feel like in a couple of years people might believe it had always been there.

There are two new retail spaces that I saw and I think given the connexion to Central this is probably more than adequate.

## Town Hall

Town Hall station also has a different exit point depending on whether you exit to the North or South. The Northern exit puts you just out front of (perhaps unsurprisingly) the Town Hall, and the Southern exit connects to Flinders Street Station's underpass and the Campbell Arcade. It also has a street exit but it was closed when I visited.

Town Hall's ground floor presence aggrieves me similarly to State Library's, although the concourse along Swanston Street here was already allocated as public space, so I am less upset about this. I believe the other exit behind Young and Jackson hotel has a similar problem to State Library, so it's not entirely off the hook.

I was very excited to return to the Campbell Arcade and hope that much of the retail there can return also. It seems that some of the space was sacrificed to the connexion to the platforms which sucks but is probably a necessary evil.

I found the walk from the Town Hall platforms to Flinders Street Station to be a bit long, about 150m if memory serves. Again there might not have been much getting around this but it feels a little inconvenient, and the journey is not made better by the sterile white glass panels.

I think the level of connexion to other public transport modes goes without saying for both this and State Library given their CBD locations so I barely feel the need to say so, but obviously the interchange for trams and other train lines is excellent.

## Anzac

The final new station is Anzac, named after the nearby Shrine of Rememberance. This was a great choice for a train station, connecting the Shrine and Albert Park to the rail network. As expected from a South-side road, the interchange with the tram network is excellent (no I'm not bitter that the West has approximately zero tram lines, why do you ask?) and Anzac station will go a long way to alleviating congestion on the tram network for those looking to ride to/from the city or further beyond.

The amount of natural light in the station was very good and there are a couple of available retail spaces which was positive. I agree with the general public's criticism that the shade sail overhead is much too small. There will certainly be days when rain gets into the station proper underneath it. 

Anzac also has a non-cloister platform so is relatively easily distinguished from the other station platforms, although being at the terminal of the tunnel means this is of somewhat more limited use.

I'd say Anzac is on the higher end of the stations in my assessment.

# In The End

I'm really glad to see the creation of a new major piece of public transport infrastructure come to completion in Melbourne. I'm hopeful that the public support for the project helps motivate the government to continue to invest in public transport infrastructure, particularly projects such as the Airport Rail link, Melton electrification project, and to expand the tram network to the drastically underserved Northern and Western suburbs.

I look forward to the day when the Metro Tunnel is just another piece of Melbourne's train network and the novelty of it is gone; hopefully then we'll know it has truly been a success.
