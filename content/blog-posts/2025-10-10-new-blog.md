I haven't touched my site in a while so I decided it's a good time for a refresh. I used Claude Code to effectively recreate the same process as was used by the old Jekyll template except I used a bespoke site template created by Loveable.

I'm really excited by the ease with which some of these generative/agentic AI tools work. It feels like magic to watch this stuff appear before your eyes. It would have taken me ages to learn enough JS to create this myself.

I'm feeling a lot more inspired to write lately and have done a lot more projects since I last posted, so I'll hopefully write about those once I work out all the bugs from the new site.
