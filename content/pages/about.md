## Site purpose
I'm the sort of person who has difficulty going deep on one hobby; instead I tend to go shallow (okay, maybe up to my knees or so) on a lot of different things. I want to document those things here so I don't forget in case I want to pick them up again later. 


## Work
My day job is as a software architect at a major bank in Australia; I'm in the solution architecture space, so I solve problems as part of new feature work mostly. I really love solving problems so I find the job quite satisfying.
